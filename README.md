# Titanic-EDA-and-Predictions

This is a dataset of people who were on the Titanic. 
I had to predict the survival rates of people aboard the Titanic. 

After using various models and doing extensive feature engineering I made it to the Top 13%!

I would suggest using the kaggle link to view my work because it is viewed better on that platform.
